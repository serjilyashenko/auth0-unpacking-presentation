# Auth0 Unpacking Presentation

This repository includes source code for my Auth0 presentation.
The project uses amazing Presentation Framework [reveal.js](http://revealjs.com/). Please check it out.

**_Note:_** Work in progress...

Check out the presentation [here](https://serjilyashenko.github.io/auth0-unpacking-presentation/).

## Approximate content:

- Regular application ⇒ cookies
- Micro-services ⇒ tokens (OAuth 2.0) + OIDC
- Auth delegation ⇒ Auth0. Possibilities. Why should use it?
- Entities of the Auth0 Dashboard
- Some scenario
